# Clickbait Titles

## Motivation

[Clickbait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait), as defined by Wikipedia, is a text or a thumbnail link that is designed to attract attention and to entice users to 
follow that link and read, view, or listen to the linked piece of online content, with a defining characteristic of being deceptive, typically sensationalized or misleading. 
It is a very interesting concept widely used in the context of today, where most thing could be found online. Most of the media outlets have to generate revenue from clicks 
made by their readers, and the increase in such outlets resulted in the use of Clickbait titles to stay ahead of the competition. Although in the long-run, clickbaits do 
not usually match up to the expectations it creates in the readers, I believe it could still be utilized as a marketing tool as long as the content is genuine enough. 
Moreover, running into Clickbait-y titles on the Internet is pretty much an everyday affair now and most people are aware of the Clickbait while still clicking the link. 
Organizations could take advantage of the fact that it is socially accepted now and utilize it with good intent.

This project explores the components which make up Clickbait titles and develop a model that can classify a title on whether it is Clickbait or not.
